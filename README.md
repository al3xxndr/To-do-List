To-do List Project Documentation

Purpose
This documentation is intended to provide guidance on how to create a To-do list using React JS. The goal is to learn the fundamental concepts and best practices of building a simple web application using React.

This documentation is authored by Joshua Alexander Meza.

Installation
To get started with building your own To-do list using React, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Once you have these installed, you can use the following steps to create a new React project:

Open your command line interface.
Run the following command to create a new directory for your project: mkdir my-react-todo-list
Navigate into the new directory: cd my-react-todo-list
Use npm to create a new React project by running the following command: npx create-react-app . (This can take several minutes)
Once the installation is complete, you can launch the project by running the following command: npm start
This will start a local development server and launch your React project in your default web browser. By default, the application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000/. Any changes you make to the code will be reflected in real-time in the browser.

Usage
To create a To-do list using React, you'll need to have a good understanding of the fundamental concepts of React, including components, state, and props. You can start by creating a simple component that displays a list of tasks. From there, you can add functionality to add new tasks, edit existing tasks, and mark tasks as completed.

It's also a good idea to use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material UI to style your application and make it look more professional.

Troubleshooting
"No package.json found" error
If you encounter an error message stating that there is no package.json file found, you can create a new package.json file in the directory or navigate to a directory that already contains a package.json file and run the npm start command from there. To create a new package.json file, you can run the following command in your terminal: npm init. This will guide you through a series of prompts to create a new package.json file for your project.

"Note that the development build is not optimized" warning
This warning message is typically seen in the context of creating a web application or a JavaScript project. It means that the build process used during development is different from the build process used in production. To create a production build, you can use the npm run build command. This will generate a set of optimized files that you can deploy to your web server.
